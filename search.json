    "text": "This document is intended as both a general-purpose lab manual and a more detailed set of guidelines and suggestions related to open science principles, ethical research practices, and conscientious data management in the context of the kinds of research and data we most often deal with in this lab.\nThe lab manual component lays out general information about the lab, our standard practices and guidelines, and what is expected of lab members in various roles. The latter part (from Lab Practices onward) goes into more detail and takes steps toward establishing formal lab policy around methodological transparency and data storage, preservation, and sharing, as well as some less prescriptive suggestions and points regarding issues I would encourage students to think critically about in their own work. This latter component is more so aimed at, and intended to be accessible to, early graduate students, but some parts may also be useful to honours students and other undergraduates curious about or considering pursuing research.\nMost of this document was written and compiled by former lab graduate student Dr. Kaitlyn Fallow and Dr. D. Stephen Lindsay, the lab PI. This current “live” manual was adapted and revised by current graduate student Eric Mah, with the aim of creating an accessible, version-controlled manual that can be updated by subsequent generations or adapted by other labs. Indeed, this online version itself uses the Quarto template provided by The Fay Lab, who provide a handy tutorial for adapting the template for other lab manuals.\nWe have consulted and been inspired by so many formal and informal sources in the course of developing this document that I am sure to miss crediting some who deserve credit, but would be remiss not to note lab manuals created by Maryam Ali, John Paul Minda, and Maureen Ritchey, from which we gained specific inspiration.\n[]https://github.com/E-Y-M/lindsay-lab-manual) < link to this book’s GitHub repository.\n\n\n\nThis lab manual is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."
