    "text": "1 Introduction\nThis document is intended as both a general-purpose lab manual and a more detailed set of guidelines and suggestions related to open science principles, ethical research practices, and conscientious data management in the context of the kinds of research and data we most often deal with in this lab.\nThe lab manual component lays out general information about the lab, our standard practices and guidelines, and what is expected of lab members in various roles. The latter part (from Lab Practices onward) goes into more detail and takes steps toward establishing formal lab policy around methodological transparency and data storage, preservation, and sharing, as well as some less prescriptive suggestions and points regarding issues I would encourage students to think critically about in their own work. This latter component is more so aimed at, and intended to be accessible to, early graduate students, but some parts may also be useful to honours students and other undergraduates curious about or considering pursuing research.\nMost of this document was written and compiled by former lab graduate student Dr. Kaitlyn Fallow and Dr. D. Stephen Lindsay, the lab PI. This current “live” manual was adapted and revised by current graduate student Eric Mah, with the aim of creating an accessible, version-controlled manual that can be updated by subsequent generations or adapted by other labs. Indeed, this online version itself uses the Quarto template provided by The Fay Lab, who provide a handy tutorial for adapting the template for other lab manuals.\nWe have consulted and been inspired by so many formal and informal sources in the course of developing this document that I am sure to miss crediting some who deserve credit, but would be remiss not to note lab manuals created by Maryam Ali, John Paul Minda, and Maureen Ritchey, from which we gained specific inspiration.\n < link to this book’s GitHub repository.\n\n\n\nThis lab manual is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "text": "2.1 Lab Meetings\nAll lab members will be expected to attend weekly lab meetings if you are available at the scheduled time. Accommodating graduate and honours students’ schedules will take priority in determining lab meeting times, so it may not always be possible to accommodate all research assistants’ schedules as well. RAs who have a scheduling conflict will generally be expected to meet or check in informally with your project group/student supervisor on a weekly basis or as agreed. If you usually attend lab meetings but can’t make it on a particular day, I appreciate advance notice if possible so I know who to expect and can cancel meetings if enough people are unavailable that it does not seem worthwhile to hold a meeting.\nLab meetings are usually fairly informal and are an opportunity for everyone to get up to date on the progress of various projects, collaboratively solve issues that come up in the course of data collection or other parts of the research process, and discuss results as they come in. Some lab meetings may be reserved for training opportunities, discussing important topics (e.g., related to open science), or for lab members to present their research findings or practice for an upcoming presentation. Graduate and honours students will typically give at least one presentation per year in lab meeting, but all lab members are welcome to take advantage of this opportunity to practice and get feedback on presentations in a friendly, supportive environment. If you are interested in doing so, please get in touch with me and I will try to reserve time for you."

Currently only two of these are occupied, so the third is available for use by honours students and research assistants on a drop-in basis as long as the room is open. We have two individual participant testing rooms, each with a desktop PC and a single monitor, located in Cornett A178 and A179. Both are equipped to run experiments using E-Prime software. These rooms are also available for student use when they are not occupied for the purpose of participant testing. Reserving these rooms for either purpose is done through a shared Google Calendar, which you will be given access to as needed or upon request."

Schedules for these labs can be viewed here. Postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and honours students working in the lab may request to reserve these labs for up to 6 hours/week once ethics approval has been obtained for a project using this form (students will have to list Steve as a sponsor). Booking requests and changes associated with the same project should all be made by the same person (e.g., a graduate student will typically coordinate their own bookings along with those of any research assistants working on their projects), and it is important these reservations be cancelled with as much notice as possible if you do not plan to use the room."

University Systems has a number of E-Prime licenses that allow for experiment administration only and can install the program in a single computer lab (20-25 people), usually one of HSD A150, A160, or A170, upon request. The CaBS department meeting room, Cornett A069, is most often used for lab meetings but is available for other purposes (e.g., holding tutorials or training sessions, practicing presentations, etc.).

    "section": "4.1 Research Assistants",
    "text": "4.1 Research Assistants\nResearch assistants (RAs) are most often involved in scheduling and testing undergraduate research participants, but sometimes work on other tasks such as data entry, transcription, developing stimulus sets, and experiment programming. The availability of paid positions varies from year to year depending on our current funding situation, so RAs are often volunteers. It is my goal for all RAs to have a rewarding and educational experience in the lab, but this is especially important if you are not being compensated for your time and labour. If at any point you feel you are not getting what you hoped out of your experience, I encourage you to talk to me so that we can try to find work and training opportunities more in line with your goals or, if that is not possible, point you toward other labs that might be a better fit.\n\n4.1.1 Hours and scheduling\nRAs are typically expected to be able to commit to around 6 hours/week of lab work on average (including weekly lab meetings, other meetings related to lab projects, and training sessions), although the availability of hours may vary substantially over the course of the semester depending on lab needs. Scheduling for most projects is highly flexible and you do not need to commit to working the same hours every week. If there are weeks you are particularly busy with midterms or other commitments, it is perfectly fine to take those weeks off from lab work entirely.\nProjects run in the lab’s individual testing rooms (Cornett A178 and A179) will require you to book space on the lab’s Google Calendar. These rooms are kept locked so if you are working on a project that requires access we will request the department assign you a key that opens both rooms as well as the external door (A177), which will require you to bring ID and a $5 deposit (that will be returned when you return the key at the end of the semester) to the Psychology main office.\nIf you are working on a project that requires booking computer lab space, you will typically request space through the graduate or honours student in charge of that project. If you need to cancel or modify a requested booking it is very important to let this person know as soon as possible.\n\n\n4.1.2 Research and Scientific Ethics\nAs a research assistant you will probably not be involved with ensuring the project you are working on adheres to ethical guidelines, but you will be responsible for putting these principles into practice by ensuring research participants are treated ethically and that any data you have access to or are involved in analyzing are handled properly. If you will be running participants recruited through UVic’s SONA system, you will be expected to be familiar with the current guidelines regarding use of this system and under what circumstances participants should receive credit, be marked as excused, or be penalized for not showing up for a session.\n\n4.1.2.1 Research Participants\nIf you are involved in testing research participants, your ethical duties will include ensuring (1) informed and ongoing consent, (2) the educational value of participation, by providing verbal or written debriefing at the end of the experiment, and (3) a positive overall experience with research participation, by treating participants fairly and kindly (within reason). You will receive additional training on these expectations before you start testing, but I will review some basics here.\nThe informed consent process will usually take the form of a printed sheet or a screen at the beginning of the experiment that participants are required to read and sign/acknowledge. Not all potential participants read this as carefully as they should, but you should do what you can to ensure this within reason (e.g., if someone turns the sheet over and signs it as soon as you hand it to them, you should politely request they take time to read it). You should be familiar with the contents of the consent form and discuss any parts you have questions about with your project supervisor so that you are prepared to address questions prospective participants might have.\nAll participants who complete or get partway through a study should be debriefed regarding the purpose of the research. We usually do this verbally, based on previous experience suggesting written debriefing documents tend to go to waste. In this case you will likely receive a script for reference. If it is not possible to deliver a verbal debriefing – e.g., if a session goes over the scheduled time, a participant has to leave quickly, or extenuating circumstances require you to terminate a session early – you should make sure all participants receive this information by email, either by doing so yourself or by letting your project supervisor know.\nFinally, it is important to treat participants with standard professionalism and politeness (within limits), even if they do not always do the same. This means being patient with participants when they are a few minutes late, seem not to be paying much attention, or otherwise inconveniencing you; taking an approach of reasonable leniency in deciding whether or not to penalize no-shows or latecomers who could, by the rules, be penalized; and always thanking everyone for their participation at the end. This does not mean that the participant is always right; providing you act within PRPS rules in applying penalties you are not obligated to give in to participant demands that you reverse such penalties, nor are you expected to put up with yelling, harassment, or otherwise disruptive/threatening behaviour. You are always entitled to terminate a session under such circumstances.\n\n\n4.1.2.2 Confidentiality and data ethics\nRAs involved in data collection will at the very least have access to participant names and contact information, and, for some projects, may also have access to other sensitive information. It is important to treat this information with appropriate care. Participants consent under the assumption of anonymity and confidentiality, which most obviously means we agree not to share any data that can be traced back to them, but also means you should not discuss individual research participants or their data with anyone outside the lab (even simply to disclose that they participated). Additionally, you must not abuse your access to participant contact information to contact anyone for reasons unrelated to their research participation. Paperwork containing participant names is typically stored securely on lab premises but if you are working on a project that requires you to keep such information on your person, or accidentally take it with you, please be very careful to store it securely.\nAs for electronically stored data, such as that generated by experimental software, you should never delete or alter raw data files for any purpose. Even if something occurs that you know will require excluding the file from later analyses, such as a computer glitch partway through, or you realize you have accidentally assigned someone the wrong participant number, you should leave the file itself as is and note the issue on the anonymized record sheet provided by your direct supervisor next to the appropriate participant number. Also, in this lab we are more interested in scientific truth than success; accordingly, you should never try to falsify or alter data, or encourage participants to respond in a certain way, in hopes of making results turn out the way we might want them to."

    "text": "4.2 Honours Students\nHonours students will take the lead on an independent research project with my guidance, and sometimes that of a graduate student co-supervisor. Most often, this takes the form of a start-to-finish study for which you collect your own data (sometimes with RA assistance), but analytically-focused projects using already existing data from our lab or elsewhere are also possible.\nFor projects that require data collection, it is important we settle on a topic early in the fall semester (ideally sometime in the summer beforehand) so things can get going as soon as possible. I will usually have a few project suggestions in mind but am open to discussion with the goal of finding a mutually beneficial project that both has some elements that interest you and fits well with lab standards and expertise.\nGeneral expectations regarding communication and ethics discussed in the previous section also apply to honours students. If your project requires a new HREB application you will be more involved in the planning stage of research ethics than RAs, but this will be a collaborative effort and you will receive guidance throughout this process.\nIn addition to attending lab meetings, honours students will also meet with me (and, if applicable, others working on the same project) on a weekly basis for progress updates, to work out any problems that arise, and to discuss the research literature relevant to your project. Usually I will provide some relevant readings at the beginning of your project as a starting point and may have additional suggestions as the project proceeds, but you are also encouraged to branch out and start exploring the literature on your own. You will be expected to maintain an annotated bibliography throughout the course of your honours year, and I will provide you with feedback on this document and more general advice aimed at improving your skills in efficiently reading and evaluating scientific literature.\nRegarding the thesis itself, we will set informal, section-by-section writing deadlines throughout the year in line with those recommended by the honours coordinator. I will provide feedback on draft sections as you complete them.\nBecause you are likely to be dealing more directly with data than RAs, you will also be subject to certain expectations regarding good data management and thorough documentation. You will also be expected, time permitting, to pre-register your research plan. Some information and guidelines related to these expectations are available in the Lab Practices section of this document, but you will receive further guidance as your project proceeds."

    "text": "5.1 Email\nMost lab-related communication will occur by email, so please make sure the email address you have on file with me/other lab members is current and an account you check regularly. You should check this account daily on weekdays while you are actively involved in data collection in case of any time-sensitive issues (e.g., room booking conflicts that might require cancellation or room changes), unless you have arranged for another mode of contact with your student supervisor/colleagues on the same project. This is also where we will contact you about lab meeting scheduling and cancellations, which, although we try to avoid it, sometimes occur fairly last minute.\nFor messages requiring a response or informing you personally of something important (e.g., a change to your usual testing room), please try to respond or acknowledge by the next business day. In the latter case a quick “got it” is sufficient; it’s just helpful to know the message wasn’t lost in the ether. You are not expected to check or reply to lab email on weekends, holidays, or anytime you have arranged for time away from data collection.\n\n5.1.1 Lab email (lindlab@uvic.ca)\nIf you are involved in data collection you will be given access to the lab email account, which is generally where research participants will contact us with questions, problems, or to let us know why they were or will be unable to make it to their scheduled session. You should check this account before and after your scheduled sessions in case there are messages relevant to you. Often this will not be clear from the subject line, so if you open a message and discover it’s not relevant to you, please make sure to mark it as unread.\nWhen communicating with participants through this account (or via SONA), keep in mind you are representing the lab; there is no need to be overly formal, but please follow basic email etiquette and include an informative subject line, a greeting, and signature. It’s preferable to sign these messages with your own name rather than just Lindsay Lab so others using the account can keep track of who’s dealing with a particular issue."

    "section": "",
    "text": "All lab members may have the opportunity to contribute to research in a way that merits authorship credit on scientific journal articles, book chapters, spoken presentations, or conference posters. I have worked with student coauthors at all levels.\nRecommendations and practices regarding how authorship credit and order (first author, second author, etc.) are determined vary widely across labs and disciplines, and can be a source of conflict (or – sometimes worse – quiet, simmering resentment). My view is that the best way to pre-empt such problems is to start discussing authorship issues at the very beginning of any project that may eventually lead to a publication or presentation, and continue to discuss and renegotiate if needed as a project proceeds and roles change. I know these discussions can be intimidating for new researchers and that differences in personality and background can make them more difficult for some people than others, but I encourage you to develop confidence in taking credit for and asserting your intellectual contributions, and hope to foster a lab environment where all members feel comfortable hashing out this issues with me and/or each other.\nThe American Psychological Association (APA) provides some useful resources regarding authorship determination and “tiebreaking” when contributions are almost equal, but projects vary widely enough that adhering to a scoring system does not always make sense. The following are contributions that would usually merit authorship credit (inspired in part by the APA recommendations): - Writing or substantially editing any part of a scientific manuscript, or developing a poster or presentation - Substantial involvement in developing the research project, including conceptual or methodological suggestions that heavily influence the direction of the project, designing the experiment(s) or instrument(s)/questionnaire(s), or conducting literature reviews - Analyzing data or selecting/planning the analytic approach, developing and testing relevant computational models, independently interpreting analytic results - Developing specialized stimulus sets (e.g., one that requires a lot of photography or videography, or substantially modifying images or sound files, or a particularly time-consuming search component). Note that you would not receive authorship credit on all publications and presentations using this stimulus set in perpetuity if you are not otherwise involved with the project, but would typically be offered credit on at least the initial publication (definitely if the stimulus set itself is published), and acknowledged/thanked in footnotes thereafter - Involvement in data collection or entry for projects where this component is particularly intensive, e.g., conducting and/or transcribing lengthy interviews\nContributions that would not usually, on their own, meet the bar for authorship, but for which you may be acknowledged by name in spoken/poster presentations and/or the footnotes of scientific publications (with your permission):\n\nData collection (i.e., testing undergraduate participants) for most projects\nStimulus set development that is limited to searching, downloading, and/or straightforward aggregation\nSimple data entry or organization\nLiterature searches limited to the search itself (i.e., no reading/reviewing, curation, or judgment involved)\n\nDetermining authorship order adds a layer of complexity, but the numbers on the scoring system linked above are a good rough guide to the kinds of contributions that are usually weighted more heavily. As a general rule, Masters, PhD, and honours students will be assigned lead/first authorship on any publications or presentations heavily based on their thesis or dissertation work. By the nature of the supervisory relationship I will often be involved enough in your projects to be listed as a coauthor (second or later, project-dependent), but supervision and provision of funding/other resources are not themselves authorship-level contributions, so this need not always be the case (e.g., for projects you pursue mostly independently, as part of a course, or with others in the department)."

Many professional societies also offer general or conference-specific travel funding opportunities for member and/or presenters. Both graduate and undergraduate students who are members of Psi Chi may be eligible for their travel awards as well.\nI will cover the costs of professional poster printing for conferences at UVic or elsewhere for lab members at any level who are interested in presenting. UVic’s Psi Chi Chapter hosts an excellent annual undergraduate research conference called Making Waves that honours students are usually required to present at, and undergraduate research assistants are strongly encouraged to consider doing so as well. It is a very friendly, low-stress introduction to conference presentations, and you can present on research or analyses you have done in the lab, as part of a class, or even a research proposal.\nAnother excellent yet low-key local-ish conference members of this lab often attend and/or present at is NOWCAM, which is held in mid-May and aims to showcase graduate and undergraduate student research. NOWCAM 2019 will be held right here at UVic so all students are especially encouraged to apply to present (and undergraduates who have already presented at Making Waves can apply to present the same poster)."

    "text": "8.1 Summary of Expectations\nThe sections below are organized roughly according to the stages of the research process, from hypothesis generation and experiment planning to long-term data management. These sections go into some detail and discuss a number of considerations/points of advice that should be considered suggestions, or things I want you to think critically about, rather than formal policy. To make it clear from the outset what I do consider policy for anyone conducting independent research in the lab:\n\nAll research and analysis plans should be pre-registered, preferably on the Open Science Framework (OSF) unless you have reason to prefer a different option.\nTo the extent that is possible, applicable, and ethical, your data, analysis scripts, and experimental materials should be made available to others in a way that does not require them to contact you for access (e.g., posted on the OSF or deposited in a dedicated data repository). These should be shared as publicly as possible given the constraints of your materials in terms of confidentiality, participant consent, and copyright considerations.\nYou should get into the habit of maintaining detailed records and organizing all files – physical and digital – related to your lab work in a fashion that will be straightforward for others (and your future self) to navigate and understand. Good practices include clear documentation of your storage system/organizational approach (e.g., in the form of “readme” files that detail the folder structure) and things like the meaning of variable names within files; using descriptive and consistent names for files, folders, and variables; and extensively annotating any scripts used for data analysis or experiment programming. A formal data management plan is encouraged and may be helpful to you, but is not required outright.\nBack up all lab data regularly, and ensure they are always stored in at least 3 locations. Your office computer and the backup server available through your office computer can count as two; the third may be a personal machine or hard drive, or the lab hard drive if needed. Cloud-based services are convenient and may be acceptable for some purposes, but should not be used for identifiable or potentially sensitive data, or anything else you would prefer kept private.\nRelated to (3) and (4), you will be expected to create a well-organized and extensively documented archive comprising all critical materials each time a project is completed. This too should be stored in multiple locations, including the lab hard drive and at least one on-site computer to facilitate access by others when you are not around or move on to other things.\nFinally, and less concrete than the others, I hope that you will be ever mindful of the barriers to scientific participation, access to knowledge, and the pursuit of scientific careers, and think critically about the ways you can help break these down in your own work."

    "section": "8.2 Open Science in Brief",
    "text": "8.2 Open Science in Brief\nFor those who are unfamiliar it may be useful to start with a brief introduction to the “open science” movement, as I will use much of the associated terminology throughout the rest of this document. In brief, open science encompasses a philosophy regarding what science should be –a collaborative, transparent, and accessible endeavour, with researchers accountable to both each other and the public – and a set of ever-evolving methodological practices aimed at bringing us closer to this goal. The utopia envisioned by open science proponents (e.g., Nosek & Bar-Anan, 2012; Nosek, Spies, & Motyl, 2012; OSF Strategic Plan) is in many ways similar to what children are taught about what science is and how it works. Unfortunately, most who are familiar with its inner workings, whether in academia or industry, are rapidly disabused of this rosy view of science as guided solely by curiosity, conscientiousness, and a commitment to sharing and updating knowledge for the betterment of all. Societal and economic realities, existing incentive structures within research and academia, and standard human weaknesses and follies such as desire for fame, power, and wealth intermix to create a science that often falls well short of what we may want it to be.\nThe open science movement in its current form is often traced back to the late 2000s/early 2010s, when concern regarding a number of high-profile failures to replicate research results, as well as appreciation and understanding of a panoply of poor research and analytic practices that were (and perhaps still are) in widespread use, began to grow in psychology and other fields (e.g., Collaboration for Open Science, 2015; Ioannidis, 2005; Simmons, Nelson, & Simonsohn, 2011). Organizations such as the multidisciplinary Center for Open Science and the psychology-focused Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science (SIPS) began to spring up in the mid-2010s with the goals of finding solutions to the various problems that had been identified and advocating for the adoption of better methodological, analytic, and communicative practices as well as larger scale structural changes.\nThe open science movement is not a monolith, and many who would count themselves among its proponents disagree on its definition and the relative importance of various kinds of “openness” that have ended up under the open science umbrella. These include open in the sense of transparency regarding research plans (stating hypotheses and planned analyses from the beginning, before analyses are undertaken) and methods (sharing data, analysis code, and other research materials publicly, or at least openly with other researchers, to facilitate reproducibility); open source (the adoption of software and systems that make their source code freely available for scrutiny and modification); open access (making research outputs such as published manuscripts freely available); and openness in the sense of facilitating collaboration, taking steps to make science as a whole more inclusive of groups who have been historically excluded or marginalized, and making knowledge more available and accessible to the public. I will mostly focus on the first sense in this document as it is the one most amenable to lab-level policy changes, but some of the others will crop up here and there."

Much of the below is adapted from Lindsay, Simons, and Lilienfeld (2016).\n\n8.3.1.1 What is pre-registration?\nPre-registering a study involves creating an unalterable, time-stamped copy of your research plan, ideally before you start data collection (but at the very least before you look at your data).\n\n\n8.3.1.2 Why should I pre-register?\nPre-registration is one of the major methodological pillars of the recent push for more open science, and for good reason; done properly, it addresses a number of known problems simultaneously. One of the major benefits of pre-registering hypotheses and analyses is that it limits questionable research practices like HARKing (Hypothesizing After the Results are Known; Kerr, 1998) by removing any doubt as to which of your results were predicted a priori and which were unexpected. The act of compiling a thorough pre-registration is also very likely to benefit you personally by forcing you to really think through the specifics of your hypotheses, design, and analysis plans before you put them into practice, and reminding you of exactly what those hypotheses and plans were when a particular study wraps up some weeks or months after you originally generated them.\n\n\n8.3.1.3 What should I pre-register?\n\n\n8.3.1.4 How do I create a pre-registration?\n\n\n8.3.1.5 What if I change my mind about something I’ve already pre-registered?"
