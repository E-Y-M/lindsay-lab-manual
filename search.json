    "text": "This document is intended as both a general-purpose lab manual and a more detailed set of guidelines and suggestions related to open science principles, ethical research practices, and conscientious data management in the context of the kinds of research and data we most often deal with in this lab.  The lab manual component lays out general information about the lab, our standard practices and guidelines, and what is expected of lab members in various roles. The latter part (from Lab Practices onward) goes into more detail and takes steps toward establishing formal lab policy around methodological transparency and data storage, preservation, and sharing, as well as some less prescriptive suggestions and points regarding issues I would encourage students to think critically about in their own work. This latter component is more so aimed at, and intended to be accessible to, early graduate students, but some parts may also be useful to honours students and other undergraduates curious about or considering pursuing research.  Most of this document was written and compiled by former lab graduate student Dr. Kaitlyn Fallow and Dr. D. Stephen Lindsay, the lab PI. This current “live” manual was adapted and revised by current graduate student Eric Mah, with the aim of creating an accessible, version-controlled manual that can be updated by subsequent generations or adapted by other labs. Indeed, this online version itself uses the Quarto template provided by The Fay Lab, who provide a handy tutorial for adapting the template for other lab manuals.  We have consulted and been inspired by so many formal and informal sources in the course of developing this document that I am sure to miss crediting some who deserve credit, but would be remiss not to note lab manuals created by Maryam Ali, John Paul Minda, and Maureen Ritchey, from which we gained specific inspiration.\n < link to this book’s GitHub repository.\n\n\n\nThis lab manual is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

Gavin’s office is room 228.\nEveryone in the lab is provided with desk space. Lab members sit either in the lab itself, or in the shared graduate student cubicle space and shared postdoc offices. Gavin encourages people to set up and work where is most comfortable. Graduate students should make use of their allocated space in the shared area but can do computational work in the lab area.\nLab meetings are held either in the lab, or in one of the SMAST-E conference rooms.\n\n\n5.5.2 Key card building & room access\nAccess to the SMAST building, and to individual lab spaces within the building is through your UMass Pass keycard. Typically, you will have access to the SMAST gate, SMAST East building, the lab space (room #245), classrooms, and if you are a grad student/postdoc you will have access to the relevant shared office space.\nThe necessary building access forms can be found on the SMAST Occupants page which need to be filled out and approved and signed by Gavin before submitting to Mike Marino and Eric Lyonnais.\n\n\n5.5.3 Parking and transportation:\nParking at either of the SMAST buildings is free and no parking pass is required. Parking on the main UMassD campus requires a digital parking pass. If you are staff this pass is free, there is a fee for students. Full details for campus parking policies and procedures are on the UMassD parking webpage. Note that there is limited short-term/temporary parking available on campus so you may feel it’s not necessary to obtain a campus parking pass."

    "text": "6.1 Working hours\nGavin generally does not hold people to working a fixed schedule, or to be in the office for a certain schedule. As adults, we should all set the working schedule that is the right fit for us, and it is likely that what this ‘fit’ is will change over the course of the time you are in the lab. Depending on the nature of your appointment, there may be specific hours that will need to be worked and you should work with your main collaborator to outline these.\nGavin generally does not work evenings or on weekends, and does not expect that people in the lab are available at these times. Lab members should also not expect others to be available during these times.\nGraduate students are generally funded on annual research assistantship (RA) stipends. The RA contracts state that this stipend is for 20 hrs of work per week during the academic year and 40 hrs per week during summer to support full time study in the academic program. Most usually, students on RAships are being paid from a research grant where the focus of the grant is the topic the student is working on for their thesis research, so there is overlap here. We believe that training to do the research is part of the job, so this would include courses and additional time to read/learn methods, software too. Some people find that counting ‘billable hours’ is productive for them as it helps them keep accountable to themselves. Others do not find this method useful. Regularly assess what works best for you.\nFull time is enough, and we do not expect team members to work nights and weekends, though do not enforce a particular working hours schedule because students should feel flexible enough to create a work schedule that works for them. Lab members should not expect others to be available during evenings and weekends. There is value to interacting with others as part of your work, and we do expect you will be available during normal working hours for at least some of the time during the week. We also recognize that there will occasionally be times where there is a need to work more to meet a deadline, but this should be the exception - an expectation of overwork is not to be normalized."

However, because we recognize that lab members should be able to create a working schedule that is right for them, lab members should not be penalized for sending communication during these times."

Look beyond those offered at SMAST to include elsewhere at UMassD, the UMass system, and also at other institutions (consider the value of a semester exchange). A list of classes that lab members have taken, and suggested course of study schedule for Fay lab grad students can be found in Chapter @ref(courses).\nWe schedule regular individual meetings with Gavin throughout the year. At a minimum during the semester these will take place every two weeks, although there may be times when more regular meetings are needed. Meetings are a chance for you to get focused time with Gavin to discuss and work on your research. Thus they are your time, not Gavin’s. Come with an agenda with a list of things that you want to accomplish and work on during that time.\nWe share our research at local, national, and international meetings, and publish our findings in the scientific literature. Gavin strives to provide financial support for grad students to attend at least one major conference per year. You should expect to give a presentation (a poster or a talk) on your work at these.\n\n6.6.1 Funding\nGavin does not typically accept students into the lab without being able to guarantee at least 2 years of full funding. Students are encouraged to seek and apply for extramural funding to support their work. This includes scholarships and fellowships to pay for salary, but also smaller grants for travel, workshop attendance, or research costs. There are many opportunities out there, particularly for students. Some resources are outlined in Chapter @ref(funding)."

Registration for each semester takes place about mid-way through the previous semester (see the university academic calendar for dates). It is critical to register promptly to facilitate faculty and institutional planning (and avoid late registration fees). Before registering for each semester, you will meet with Gavin to review your tracking sheet (SMAST academic milestone document) and discuss registration plans for the forthcoming semester (courses and/or research credits, continuation).\nSee Chapter @ref(courses) for details of courses available to IMS graduate students.\nCourse of study should be selected with the program requirements in mind - as always, refer to the Intercampus Marine Science Program Manual for details.\nMost students take many of their core program requirements in the first year. An exception may be PhD students who save one of the Oceanography requirements for the 2nd year, depending on other courses being offered.\nThesis credits: These are required for both MS (thesis-based) and PhD degrees. For the PhD, research credits take the form of pre-dissertation credits if completed before advancing to candidacy. Pre-dissertation research credits taken during the semester in which a student completes their comprehensive exams (i.e. passes their proposal defense) can be converted after the fact to dissertation credits. Once thesis and dissertation credit requirements have been met, MS and PhD students will often maintain registration through ‘continuation of program’ credit, where no credits are earned but enrollment status is maintained.\nUMassD student thesis templates and guidance\nChang Liu’s LaTeX thesis templates"

The proposal also serves as a guiding document for your initial committee meeting(s). Scope and plans for the MS thesis research will be developed through your meetings with Gavin and with the project team (for students whose work is being funded by a research grant). Your thesis proposal should contain a literature review, identification of research questions, an overview of the methods that will be used, and description of expected results and relevance/significance of the research.

While building your proposal, discuss with Gavin who should be on the committee. Three committee members is the usual size, though sometimes students will have a fourth member. Generally in our program a committee will be made up of your advisor (Gavin), an additional UMassD faculty member, and an external member (often an agency collaborator on the project, e.g. at NOAA NMFS).

    "text": "10.2 Ph.D. students\nPhD dissertations in the Fay lab tend to comprise chapters that will form ~4 publications. Gavin encourages students to think about dissertation chapters as publishable units. In the disseration, these 4 chapters will be accompanied by a general Introduction, and a concluding Synthesis chapter that ties the work presented in the dissertation together under the overarching research theme and goals.\nMilestones\n\n10.2.1 Pre-proposal (or “Preposal”, copyright M. Winton)\nPhD students in the Fay lab prepare a pre-proposal during their first year to outline the overall goals and themes of the dissertation research topic, and identify the individual research chapter topic questions. The pre-proposal serves as a guiding document and conversation starter for your initial committee meeting. Scope and plans for the thesis research will be developed through your meetings with Gavin and with the project team (for students whose work is being funded by a research grant). Your pre-proposal should contain a literature review, identification of research questions and potential chapter units, an overview of the methods that will be used to address the research questions, proposed course of study (coursework, etc.), and relevance/significance of the research. Aim for the pre-proposal to be about 5 pages of text. A 2-page precis version is useful when initially talking with committee members. While not a formal requirement for the IMS program, a pre-proposal serves to clarify student interests and goals for the degree for both the student and the thesis committee, and serves as a blueprint for building out the preliminary work and the dissertation proposal (indeed you may likely re-use some of the text later).\n\n\n10.2.2 Dissertation Committee\nYour PhD thesis committee serves as your guidance team during your research, and should be viewed as colleagues and collaborators. There is a required minimum for interaction with the committee, but you should add to this. After you have formed the committee, it is advisable to hold a committee meeting at least once a year, but it is encouraged to continuingly interact with committee members.\nWhile building your pre-proposal, discuss with Gavin who should be on the committee. For PhD committees, four members is the usual size, though often students will have a fifth member. Generally in our program a committee will be made up of your advisor (Gavin), two additional UMassD faculty members, and 1-2 external members (e.g. agency collaborators on the project funding the research, e.g. collaborators at NOAA NMFS). Aim to hold your first committee meeting no later than during the 3rd semester of your program. See the official university guidelines for more specifics [link here].\n[something on what is expected at committee meetings, e.g. presentation]\n\n\n10.2.3 Comprehensive Exams\nAs detailed in the IMS policy, PhD students undertake a two-part comprehensive examination, a 2-day written exam, and a public presentation and defense of the proposal. The written exam is taken once students have completed their coursework requirements (say after the 4th or before/during the 5th semester). Questions on the written exam include both open and closed book sections and will cover coursework and questions related to your field and dissertation topics. The proposal defense is usually scheduled the semester following successful completion of the written exam. Full requirement details for the exams are in the IMS policy. The comprehensive exam will be planned in coordination with Gavin, and the written exam requires 1 month preparation time (1 month of full-time work). See guidance below. [Written exam format & guidance] [Proposal defense format & guidance]\n\n\n10.2.4 Dissertation Proposal\nA proposal describing the research that will comprise the dissertation is a required, formal part of the academic program. Proposals should describe the goals and themes of the research to be conducted, and its context within current state of knowledge. The proposal should outline the research questions that each chapter will address, and give a description of the methods that will be used in each. The proposal serves as a guiding document for the remainder of your program and is the document that you and your committee will use to agree on the scope of work to be completed to fulfill the degree requirements. Your thesis proposal should contain a literature review, identification of research questions, an overview of the methods that will be used for each of these, and description of expected results and relevance/significance of the research. Aim for the proposal to be about 15 pages of text. Detail of planning for each chapter will not be as comprehensive (it is expected that later chapters may not be as fleshed out), but the proposal should provide enough detail of what the student will do for the committee to evaluate whether the scope of work is sufficient (and likely make recommendations for reducing or refining this). It is common for students to have completed or be close to having completed work for at least one of the chapters by the time of defending the proposal.\nUltimately, the proposal serves to clarify and outline expectations for the degree for both the student and the thesis committee, and serves as a blueprint for building out the thesis itself (indeed you will re-use some of the text later).\nPhD Thesis: [guidance on thesis structure to come]\nRemember, not everything will go to plan and your interests and findings may change.
