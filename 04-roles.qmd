# Roles and Expectations

## Research Assistants

Research assistants (RAs) are most often involved in scheduling and testing undergraduate research participants, but sometimes work on other tasks such as data entry, transcription, developing stimulus sets, and experiment programming. The availability of paid positions varies from year to year depending on our current funding situation, so RAs are often volunteers. It is my goal for all RAs to have a rewarding and educational experience in the lab, but this is especially important if you are not being compensated for your time and labour. If at any point you feel you are not getting what you hoped out of your experience, I encourage you to talk to me so that we can try to find work and training opportunities more in line with your goals or, if that is not possible, point you toward other labs that might be a better fit.

### Hours and scheduling

RAs are typically expected to be able to commit to around 6 hours/week of lab work on average (including weekly lab meetings, other meetings related to lab projects, and training sessions), although the availability of hours may vary substantially over the course of the semester depending on lab needs. Scheduling for most projects is highly flexible and you do not need to commit to working the same hours every week. If there are weeks you are particularly busy with midterms or other commitments, it is perfectly fine to take those weeks off from lab work entirely.

Projects run in the lab's individual testing rooms (Cornett A178 and A179) will require you to book space on the lab's Google Calendar. These rooms are kept locked so if you are working on a project that requires access we will request the department assign you a key that opens both rooms as well as the external door (A177), which will require you to bring ID and a \$5 deposit (that will be returned when you return the key at the end of the semester) to the Psychology main office.

If you are working on a project that requires booking computer lab space, you will typically request space through the graduate or honours student in charge of that project. If you need to cancel or modify a requested booking it is very important to let this person know as soon as possible.

### RA Onboarding

RAs that will be taking on hourly paid roles will need to fill out a [new hire form](https://www.uvic.ca/vpfo/financial-services/assets/docs/payroll/Resources/dept-web-time-entry/new-rehire-form-web-time-entry.pdf) (Note that you may need to login with your UVic account to access this form). This form may also be provided to you by the lab manager or supervising graduate student. For information on how to enter your worked hours for approval, see [this link](https://www.uvic.ca/vpfo/financial-services//resources/payroll/employee-dashboard/entering-your-timesheet.php).

### Research and Scientific Ethics

As a research assistant you will probably not be involved with ensuring the project you are working on adheres to ethical guidelines, but you will be responsible for putting these principles into practice by ensuring research participants are treated ethically and that any data you have access to or are involved in analyzing are handled properly. If you will be running participants recruited through UVic's SONA system, you will be expected to be familiar with the [current guidelines](https://www.uvic.ca/socialsciences/psychology/research/participants/index.php) regarding use of this system and under what circumstances participants should receive credit, be marked as excused, or be penalized for not showing up for a session.

#### Research Participants

If you are involved in testing research participants, your ethical duties will include ensuring (1) informed and ongoing consent, (2) the educational value of participation, by providing verbal or written debriefing at the end of the experiment, and (3) a positive overall experience with research participation, by treating participants fairly and kindly (within reason). You will receive additional training on these expectations before you start testing, and will be required to complete the [Tri-Council Policy Statement (TCPS-2 CORE) ethical certification course](https://tcps2core.ca/welcome), but I will review some basics here.

The informed consent process will usually take the form of a printed sheet or a screen at the beginning of the experiment that participants are required to read and sign/acknowledge. Not all potential participants read this as carefully as they should, but you should do what you can to ensure this within reason (e.g., if someone turns the sheet over and signs it as soon as you hand it to them, you should politely request they take time to read it). You should be familiar with the contents of the consent form and discuss any parts you have questions about with your project supervisor so that you are prepared to address questions prospective participants might have.

All participants who complete or get partway through a study should be debriefed regarding the purpose of the research. We usually do this verbally, based on previous experience suggesting written debriefing documents tend to go to waste. In this case you will likely receive a script for reference. If it is not possible to deliver a verbal debriefing -- e.g., if a session goes over the scheduled time, a participant has to leave quickly, or extenuating circumstances require you to terminate a session early -- you should make sure all participants receive this information by email, either by doing so yourself or by letting your project supervisor know.

Finally, it is important to treat participants with standard professionalism and politeness (within limits), even if they do not always do the same. This means being patient with participants when they are a few minutes late, seem not to be paying much attention, or otherwise inconveniencing you; taking an approach of reasonable leniency in deciding whether or not to penalize no-shows or latecomers who could, by the rules, be penalized; and always thanking everyone for their participation at the end. This does not mean that the participant is always right; providing you act within PRPS rules in applying penalties you are not obligated to give in to participant demands that you reverse such penalties, nor are you expected to put up with yelling, harassment, or otherwise disruptive/threatening behaviour. You are always entitled to terminate a session under such circumstances.

#### Confidentiality and data ethics

RAs involved in data collection will at the very least have access to participant names and contact information, and, for some projects, may also have access to other sensitive information. It is important to treat this information with appropriate care. Participants consent under the assumption of anonymity and confidentiality, which most obviously means we agree not to share any data that can be traced back to them, but also means you should not discuss individual research participants or their data with anyone outside the lab (even simply to disclose that they participated). Additionally, you must not abuse your access to participant contact information to contact anyone for reasons unrelated to their research participation. Paperwork containing participant names is typically stored securely on lab premises but if you are working on a project that requires you to keep such information on your person, or accidentally take it with you, please be very careful to store it securely.

As for electronically stored data, such as that generated by experimental software, you should **never** delete or alter raw data files for any purpose. Even if something occurs that you know will require excluding the file from later analyses, such as a computer glitch partway through, or you realize you have accidentally assigned someone the wrong participant number, you should leave the file itself as is and note the issue on the anonymized record sheet provided by your direct supervisor next to the appropriate participant number. Also, in this lab we are more interested in scientific truth than success; accordingly, you should **never** try to falsify or alter data, or encourage participants to respond in a certain way, in hopes of making results turn out the way we might want them to.

## Honours Students

Honours students will take the lead on an independent research project with my guidance, and sometimes that of a graduate student co-supervisor. Most often, this takes the form of a start-to-finish study for which you collect your own data (sometimes with RA assistance), but analytically-focused projects using already existing data from our lab or elsewhere are also possible.

For projects that require data collection, it is important we settle on a topic early in the fall semester (ideally sometime in the summer beforehand) so things can get going as soon as possible. I will usually have a few project suggestions in mind but am open to discussion with the goal of finding a mutually beneficial project that both has some elements that interest you and fits well with lab standards and expertise.

General expectations regarding communication and ethics discussed in the previous section also apply to honours students. If your project requires a new HREB application you will be more involved in the planning stage of research ethics than RAs, but this will be a collaborative effort and you will receive guidance throughout this process.

In addition to attending lab meetings, honours students will also meet with me (and, if applicable, others working on the same project) on a weekly basis for progress updates, to work out any problems that arise, and to discuss the research literature relevant to your project. Usually I will provide some relevant readings at the beginning of your project as a starting point and may have additional suggestions as the project proceeds, but you are also encouraged to branch out and start exploring the literature on your own. You will be expected to maintain an [annotated bibliography](https://www.lib.sfu.ca/help/cite-write/citation-style-guides/annotated-bibliography) throughout the course of your honours year, and I will provide you with feedback on this document and more general advice aimed at improving your skills in efficiently reading and evaluating scientific literature.

Regarding the thesis itself, we will set informal, section-by-section writing deadlines throughout the year in line with those recommended by the honours coordinator. I will provide feedback on draft sections as you complete them.

Because you are likely to be dealing more directly with data than RAs, you will also be subject to certain expectations regarding good data management and thorough documentation. You will also be expected, time permitting, to pre-register your research plan. Some information and guidelines related to these expectations are available in the Lab Practices section of this document, but you will receive further guidance as your project proceeds.
