# Introduction

This document is intended as both a general-purpose lab manual and a
more detailed set of guidelines and suggestions related to open science
principles, ethical research practices, and conscientious data
management in the context of the kinds of research and data we most
often deal with in this lab.

The lab manual component lays out
general information about the lab, our standard practices and
guidelines, and what is expected of lab members in various roles. The
latter part (from Lab Practices onward) goes into more detail and takes
steps toward establishing formal lab policy around methodological
transparency and data storage, preservation, and sharing, as well as
some less prescriptive suggestions and points regarding issues I would
encourage students to think critically about in their own work. This
latter component is more so aimed at, and intended to be accessible to,
early graduate students, but some parts may also be useful to honours
students and other undergraduates curious about or considering pursuing
research.

Most of this document was written and compiled by former
lab graduate student [Dr. Kaitlyn
Fallow](https://www.uvic.ca/socialsciences/psychology/people/graduate/recent-graduates/fallowkaitlyn.php)
and [Dr. D. Stephen
Lindsay](https://www.uvic.ca/socialsciences/psychology/people/faculty-directory/lindsaysteve.php),
the lab PI. This current "live" manual was adapted and revised by
current graduate student [Eric Mah](https://ericymah.netlify.app/), with
the aim of creating an accessible, version-controlled manual that can be
updated by subsequent generations or adapted by other labs. Indeed, this
online version itself uses the Quarto template provided by [The Fay
Lab](https://thefaylab.github.io/lab-manual/), who provide a handy
tutorial for adapting the template for other lab manuals. <br> We have
consulted and been inspired by so many formal and informal sources in
the course of developing this document that I am sure to miss crediting
some who deserve credit, but would be remiss not to note lab manuals
created by [Maryam Ali](https://github.com/alylab/labmanual), [John Paul
Minda](https://osf.io/8b6kj/), and [Maureen
Ritchey](https://github.com/memobc/memolab-manual), from which we gained
specific inspiration.
