# Updating this document

The intention is that this document serve as a "living" lab manual that
is constantly updated/adapted as necessary. To facilitate this, I have
included the following basic guide. Updating the lab manual requires
Git(Hub) and R(Studio) but I have written the guide with the intention
that those with no prior experience can proceed without too much hassle.
Note that although the basic steps will likely remain the same in the
years to come, there may be minor deviations due to updates to the
requisite software packages. For non-lab users that are interested in
adapting this manual, I suggest using the Fay Lab's manual (the original
template) and their accompanying
[guide](https://github.com/thefaylab/lab-manual/wiki/Quick-steps-to-making-a-copy-of-the-lab-manual-&-publishing-it).

1.  Install the latest versions of
    [R](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) and
    [RStudio/Posit](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/)

2.  Install the latest version of
    [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)

3.  Install the latest version of [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and create
    an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/)

4.  Request administrator access to the [GitHub project for the lab
    manual](https://github.com/E-Y-M/lindsay-lab-manual) via email
    (ericmah\@uvic.ca)

5.  In RStudio, create a new project ("File" -\> "New Project"), and
    select "Version Control", and "Git"

6.  On the GitHub page, click the green "Code" button, navigate to the
    "Local" tab, and select "HTTPS". Copy the link in the box below

7.  Paste this link into the "Repository URL" box in RStudio. When
    selecting a folder (subdirectory) for the project, it doesn't matter
    where you put it, but you should avoid putting it in any cloud
    storage folders (Dropbox), as these can interfere with Git.

8.  Once you confirm, RStudio will clone the files to the local folder
    that you specified.

9.  You are now ready to edit the manual. A complete guide to formatting
    markdown files using Quarto is beyond the scope of this manual, but
    see [this
    link](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html) for a
    comprehensive guide. Quarto has a visual editor UI that is quite
    similar to traditional word processors (e.g., Word). Below, I
    include a couple common changes that you might want to make:

    1.  Adding a new page: The simplest way to do this is to create a
        new Quarto markdown (.qmd) document, or copying one of the
        existing markdown files (e.g., 01-introduction.qmd). To add the
        new page into the manual, open the "\_quarto.yml" file, and add
        the new page to the "chapters" section near the bottom of the
        file in the position that you want it. It is recommended (but
        not required) that you update the names/numbers of the existing
        pages for any new order that you create.

    2.  Editing existing pages: This is done simply by opening,
        changing, and saving the existing .qmd files. The landing page
        for the lab manual is the "index.qmd" file. See the formatting
        guide linked above for tips on formatting various kinds of
        content.

10. Once you have made the desired changes, you will need to "push" them
    to GitHub. This can be done by navigating to the terminal
    (bottom-left box in RStudio) and inputting the following bolded
    commands (except anything in parentheses):

    1.  `git add â€“A`

    2.  `git commit -m "Your message here"` (In the quotations, enter a
        short message describing your changes) c

    3.  `git push` (You may be prompted to enter your GitHub password
        here)

11. Now that the changes have been made to the GitHub, you will need to
    sync them so that the website link updates as well. Go back to the
    manual GitHub page, click on "Settings", and go to "Secrets".

12. Click on the "New repository secret" in the upper right

13. You will be prompted to enter a "Name" for the secret. In this box,
    enter `EMAIL`

14. In the "Value" box, enter the email associated with your GitHub
    account, and click "Add secret"

15. Now, any time you commit changes to the manual, it should be updated
    on the live page. To verify this, you can go to the "Actions" tab on
    the manual GitHub page, click on the latest "pages-build-deployment"
    Action once it is completed (green check mark), and then navigate to
    the [lab manual link shown in the "deploy"
    box](https://e-y-m.github.io/lindsay-lab-manual/)

16. That's all! Remember to update the contact email(s) in step 4. of
    this guide to your own.
