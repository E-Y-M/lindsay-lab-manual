# Lab Practices

This section is intended as a starting point toward establishing more formal lab policy regarding methodological transparency, data management practices, and research ethics above and beyond the mandated baseline. Best practices in these domains are constantly evolving so I expect this document will be regularly updated. These policies (and less formal recommendations) will be mostly applicable to graduate students who will be conducting original research in the lab over a longer term, but honours students will also be expected to adopt some of these practices, and others interested in research may find some tidbits of interest. 

These guidelines have been heavily influenced by the open science movement and the avalanche of best practice recommendations that have come out of it. As mentioned earlier, we are, as a lab, currently in a bit of a period of transition in attempting to bring our own practices in line with what we believe should be done from an open science perspective. Some of the steps toward improving practices may involve a steep learning curve such that it may take weeks, months, or even years for it to be feasible for you to fully implement them; shifting toward a script-based workflow, for example, may be especially daunting for those with little or no programming experience. Some steps can also be easy to forget if you are not used to incorporating them into your research workflow (such as hitting the “register” button on a pre-registration). There are bound to be stumbles, but as they say, “perfect is the enemy of good” – you might not be able to make your work 100% open, transparent, and reproducible tomorrow, but there are still steps you can take to make it more open, transparent, and reproducible. My main expectation of students and others conducting original research in the lab is thus that you be willing to learn and strive to improve your research and data management practices, and of course feel free to push me to improve mine when needed.


## Summary of Expectations

The sections below are organized roughly according to the stages of the research process, from hypothesis generation and experiment planning to long-term data management. These sections go into some detail and discuss a number of considerations/points of advice that should be considered suggestions, or things I want you to think critically about, rather than formal policy. To make it clear from the outset what I do consider policy for anyone conducting independent research in the lab:

1.	All research and analysis plans should be pre-registered, preferably on the Open Science Framework (OSF) unless you have reason to prefer a different option.
2.	To the extent that is possible, applicable, and ethical, your data, analysis scripts, and experimental materials should be made available to others in a way that does not require them to contact you for access (e.g., posted on the OSF or deposited in a dedicated data repository). These should be shared as publicly as possible given the constraints of your materials in terms of confidentiality, participant consent, and copyright considerations.
3.	You should get into the habit of maintaining detailed records and organizing all files – physical and digital – related to your lab work in a fashion that will be straightforward for others (and your future self) to navigate and understand. Good practices include clear documentation of your storage system/organizational approach (e.g., in the form of “readme” files that detail the folder structure) and things like the meaning of variable names within files; using descriptive and consistent names for files, folders, and variables; and extensively annotating any scripts used for data analysis or experiment programming. A formal data management plan is encouraged and may be helpful to you, but is not required outright.
4.	Back up all lab data regularly, and ensure they are always stored in at least 3 locations. Your office computer and the backup server available through your office computer can count as two; the third may be a personal machine or hard drive, or the lab hard drive if needed. Cloud-based services are convenient and may be acceptable for some purposes, but should not be used for identifiable or potentially sensitive data, or anything else you would prefer kept private.
5.	Related to (3) and (4), you will be expected to create a well-organized and extensively documented archive comprising all critical materials each time a project is completed. This too should be stored in multiple locations, including the lab hard drive and at least one on-site computer to facilitate access by others when you are not around or move on to other things.
6.	Finally, and less concrete than the others, I hope that you will be ever mindful of the barriers to scientific participation, access to knowledge, and the pursuit of scientific careers, and think critically about the ways you can help break these down in your own work. 

## Open Science in Brief

For those who are unfamiliar it may be useful to start with a brief introduction to the “open science” movement, as I will use much of the associated terminology throughout the rest of this document. In brief, open science encompasses a philosophy regarding what science should be –a collaborative, transparent, and accessible endeavour, with researchers accountable to both each other and the public – and a set of ever-evolving methodological practices aimed at bringing us closer to this goal. The utopia envisioned by open science proponents (e.g., Nosek & Bar-Anan, 2012; Nosek, Spies, & Motyl, 2012; [OSF Strategic Plan](https://osf.io/x2w9h/)) is in many ways similar to what children are taught about what science is and how it works. Unfortunately, most who are familiar with its inner workings, whether in academia or industry, are rapidly disabused of this rosy view of science as guided solely by curiosity, conscientiousness, and a commitment to sharing and updating knowledge for the betterment of all. Societal and economic realities, existing incentive structures within research and academia, and standard human weaknesses and follies such as desire for fame, power, and wealth intermix to create a science that often falls well short of what we may want it to be.

The open science movement in its current form is often traced back to the late 2000s/early 2010s, when concern regarding a number of high-profile failures to replicate research results, as well as appreciation and understanding of a panoply of poor research and analytic practices that were (and perhaps still are) in widespread use, began to grow in psychology and other fields (e.g., Collaboration for Open Science, 2015; Ioannidis, 2005; Simmons, Nelson, & Simonsohn, 2011). Organizations such as the multidisciplinary [Center for Open Science](https://cos.io/) and the psychology-focused [Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science (SIPS)](https://improvingpsych.org/) began to spring up in the mid-2010s with the goals of finding solutions to the various problems that had been identified and advocating for the adoption of better methodological, analytic, and communicative practices as well as larger scale structural changes.

The open science movement is not a monolith, and many who would count themselves among its proponents disagree on its definition and the relative importance of various kinds of “openness” that have ended up under the open science umbrella. These include open in the sense of transparency regarding research plans (stating hypotheses and planned analyses from the beginning, before analyses are undertaken) and methods (sharing data, analysis code, and other research materials publicly, or at least openly with other researchers, to facilitate reproducibility); open source (the adoption of software and systems that make their source code freely available for scrutiny and modification); [open access](http://www.carl-abrc.ca/advancing-research/scholarly-communication/open-access/) (making research outputs such as published manuscripts freely available); and openness in the sense of facilitating collaboration, taking steps to make science as a whole more inclusive of groups who have been historically excluded or marginalized, and making knowledge more available and accessible to the public. I will mostly focus on the first sense in this document as it is the one most amenable to lab-level policy changes, but some of the others will crop up here and there.


## Hypothesis and Experiment Planning

### Pre-registration

Although the formal act of pre-registration will probably be one of the last steps you undertake in the experiment-planning process, this step will be much easier if you have it in mind from the start, and as it is one of the most important from an open science perspective it is worth discussing first. Much of the below is adapted from Lindsay, Simons, and Lilienfeld (2016).

#### What is pre-registration?

Pre-registering a study involves creating an unalterable, time-stamped copy of your research plan, ideally before you start data collection (but at the very least before you look at your data). 

#### Why should I pre-register?

Pre-registration is one of the major methodological pillars of the recent push for more open science, and for good reason; done properly, it addresses a number of known problems simultaneously. One of the major benefits of pre-registering hypotheses and analyses is that it limits questionable research practices like HARKing (Hypothesizing After the Results are Known; Kerr, 1998) by removing any doubt as to which of your results were predicted a priori and which were unexpected. The act of compiling a thorough pre-registration is also very likely to benefit you personally by forcing you to really think through the specifics of your hypotheses, design, and analysis plans before you put them into practice, and reminding you of exactly what those hypotheses and plans were when a particular study wraps up some weeks or months after you originally generated them.
