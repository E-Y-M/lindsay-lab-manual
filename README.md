This ~~bookdown~~ Quarto book is intended to be used for **incoming, current, and outgoing** members of the Fay lab group. If we missed anything, please let Gavin Fay (gfay@umassd.edu) or Madeleine Guyant (mguyant@umassd.edu) know. You can also do a pull request and we will review the changes. 

We hope this has all the answers you need!
